          <h2>Starting My Web Development Journey</h2>
          <p>When I first started learning web development, I was overwhelmed by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But as I built small projects, everything started making sense. Now, I enjoy turning ideas into functional web pages and constantly improving my skills.</p>

          <h2>Why I Love React and TailwindCSS</h2>
          <p>React's component-based structure and TailwindCSS's utility-first approach have made my workflow more efficient. I enjoy how React simplifies state management and how Tailwind lets me style quickly without writing extra CSS.</p>
